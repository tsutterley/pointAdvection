Setup and Installation
======================

Dependencies
############
This software is dependent on open source programs that can be installed using OS-specific package management systems,
`conda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo>`_ or from source:

- `GDAL <https://gdal.org/index.html>`_
- `GEOS <https://trac.osgeo.org/geos>`_
- `PROJ <https://proj.org/>`_
- `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org>`_
- `netCDF <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`_

The version of GDAL used within ``pointAdvection`` will match the version of the installed C program.
The path to the C program that will be used with ``pointAdvection`` is given by:

.. code-block:: bash

    gdal-config --datadir

The ``pointAdvection`` installation uses the ``gdal-config`` routines to set the GDAL package version.
